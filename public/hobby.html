    <h2>Pastry Baking</h2>
        <p>I love baking and started it since I was in middle school. It was the time that I started to get bored of online games (beause my fav ones were permanentally closed.)</p>
        <p>I have a mini account for my baking journey on <a href="https://instagram.com/flybybutter?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Instagram</a> too!</p>
        <img src="../assets/images/chocolate-cookie-dough.jpeg" alt="chocolate mochi cookie dough" height="400">
        <p><i>Chocolate cookie dough with mochi fillings</i></p>
    <h2>Digital Art</h2>
        <p>I also have another account but for my digital art on <a href="https://instagram.com/fluffandbutter?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Instagram</a>. 
        <p>ince I was young, I love doodling during classes (my apologies for not paying attention to what teachers were teaching). Most of my textbooks were filled with cute little doodles.</p>

        <p><i>These are characters that I designed: Fluff (little boy) & Butter (little bird).</i></p>
        
    <h2>Crochet</h2>
       <p>I just found this hobby in 2023. Currently, I am working on black shorts. Love to make things from scratch :)</p>
    <h2>EDM and Festivals</h2>
        <p>Marshmello is my all time favorite DJ. I love heavy bass and dancing like no one is watching.</p>
        <p>(I drink reponsibly ;D)</p>
